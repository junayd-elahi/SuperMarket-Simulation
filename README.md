# SuperMarket-Simulation

<h2>Description</h2>
A very basic concept of how a normal supermarket would handle customers with different conditions such as amount of items in a basket, uses different types of logic to sort the customer with as many lanes as avaliable to ensure the lanes stay continously flowing and efficent.
<br />


<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Python</b> 

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Pycharm</b>

  <br> Uses the Tkinter libary to make a basic GUI <br/>
<br />

  <br> When the program starts only two lanes stay open the normal lanes and the self checlout lanes <br/>
<br />

Processing customers: <br/>

<br> creates a random number of customers and with a random number of items in a basket and usese the length of the lane and items in basket to determine how long it will take to process.<br/>
